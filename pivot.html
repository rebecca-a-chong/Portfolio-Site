            <p>Answering the question “What do I want to do in life?” is a daunting task and
                it’s common for this answer to change. In fact, in <a
                    href=https://www.indeed.com/leadershiphub/career-change>a survey conducted by Indeed’s Editorial
                    Team,</a></p>

            <p><span class="accent-text">49%</span> of respondents had made a dramatic career shift, with 88% of them
                ultimately happier since making the change and</p>
            <p><span class="accent-text">65%</span> of respondents who hadn’t changed careers indicated that they were
                currently thinking about, or had previously considered, switching.</p>

            <p>Inspired by these results and my personal career journey, I aimed to design a
                solution that could help others navigate their career transition with confidence.</p>

                Question” button. When an answer is received, Pivoters will receive a notification with a link to the
                clip containing their answer.</p>
