                <p>Although this was an academic project, I treated Pivot as a genuine, market-ready product, incorporating
                    features to ensure sustained engagement from both Pivoters and Experts. In
                    particular, I explored monetization avenues in search of an equilibrium between a user’s access to
                    valuable information and the app's financial viability. After careful consideration of
                    several options, I ultimately decided on a tipping feature, directing 100% of contributions to Experts.
                    This choice was made to strategically reach a critical mass of users, therefore enhancing future ad revenue projections.
                    Overall, it was interesting to observe just how much of an influence a business’ goals had on potential solutions.
                </p>

                <p></p>A future opportunity I would like to explore further is Experts’ view of the app. As a
                spreadsheet/dashboard fanatic, I would love to visualize how Experts could track their audience
                engagement with metrics such as watch time, re-watches, follower growth etc.
